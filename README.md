**About:** For this project, I was interesting in extending my "Hats of the Smithsonian" project by focusing on creating a color driven search. I extended the data to include all fashion related objects from the Smithsonian Open Access Collection as I was also curious about different colors in fabrics, jewelry, shirts, pants, etc. I had a lot of fun experimenting with extracting color swatches and learnning d3.force. I also added an experimental "show gradients" button to create some coded art based on the selected colors!

My goals are to include a couple of unconventional ways of searching the data via color. First, I am curious about gradients between colors and how different colors can be clustered together to create color palettes. Collections of colors might combine fashion objects across eras and museums, so it could be interesting to create a very minimal interface that forces the users to really rely on color and nothing else. I would also want to lay out the clusters by location and use a simple map as the background to allow the most focus on the colors.
