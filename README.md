**About:** For this project, I was interesting in extending my "Hats of the Smithsonian" project by focusing on creating a color driven search. I extended the data to include all fashion related objects from the Smithsonian Open Access Collection as I was also curious about different colors in fabrics, jewelry, shirts, pants, etc. I had a lot of fun experimenting with extracting color swatches and learnning d3.force. I also added an experimental "show gradients" button to create some coded art based on the selected colors!

My goals are to include a couple of unconventional ways of searching the data via color. First, I am curious about gradients between colors and how different colors can be clustered together to create color palettes. Collections of colors might combine fashion objects across eras and museums, so it could be interesting to create a very minimal interface that forces the users to really rely on color and nothing else. I would also want to lay out the clusters by location and use a simple map as the background to allow the most focus on the colors.

# Sketches
sketches! These are my initial ideas of how to further explore my hats project and add more interaction. The first one is combining the hats data with the national portrait gallery to see "what people where what hats" by finding similarities in date, gender, financial status, etc and then stitching the hats with the people. 
The second and third ideas both explore extracting swatches/colors from the image and using that as a driving force for creating a collection (emphasis on the collection aspect this time).
