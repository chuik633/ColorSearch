They date back to the 17th century but were most actively in use during the 18th and 19th century. These pencas were first associated with \u201cfor profit slaves\u201d, enslaved people who worked for wages in urban Brazilian cities. While these people were forced to pay most of their earnings to slave owners, they were able to retain the remainder of their wages. Enslaved and freed Afro-Brazilians used their wages to purchase jewelry like this from local artisans as a means of cultural expression, spiritual protection, and wealth storage. These objects were extremely valuable, often written into wills as key asset to be adjudicated. The fastener and the charms were crafted out of gold or silver and were worn around the waist or on the wrist."

Syncretic ornaments, Penca de Balangand\u00e3 merge values and aesthetics of baroque Catholicism and traditional African practices. Many of the charms carry dual meanings of Catholic symbolism and Afro-Brazillian orixas. The charms were curated by their individual owner to have specific aspects of spiritual protection. They were often called \u201cpenca\u201d meaning bouquet, as the charms are closely grouped together, and \u201cBalangand\u00e3\u201d, an onomatopoetic word for the sound of the charms clinking together. While these ornaments were traditionally made of metal, they also included pieces of bone, coral, wood and stone to add to ornamentation."

The two birds engraved into the clasp may represent Africa and the Americas, with the shape of the clasp symbolizing the slave ship that transported enslaved Africans across the Atlantic. Within the candombl\u00e9 faith, grapes represent the orisha Oxum and are also symbols of female fertility, passion, and life. Fish is also a symbol of fertility and a representation of the orisha Lemanj\u00e1. The pineapple and mandarin generally represent fertility of the land while the cashew apple represents the orisha Xango and is a symbol of vitality. The tusk is an object of superstition, and the dark wood of the figa (wooden hand) possibly indicates a stronger protection against the evil eye. The figa itself represents sexuality and fertility to attract positive energy and reproduction. The cylinder is used to store herbs and other pieces of wood. These bundles were meant to protect against back luck. It might have been used to hold incense."

Ellen Jane Knight, known familiarly as \u201cNellie,\u201d was the niece of Massachusetts lieutenant governor Horatio Gates Knight, and lived in his household after her mother died. She graduated from Williston Seminary (now the Williston Northampton School), a co-educational academy, and taught music. In 1865 she married James Henry Bradford, who served as a chaplain in the Union Army before becoming a Congregational minister. They lived in various places in the northeast, usually pursuing work in education, and moved to Washington, D.C. in 1881. Ellen Bradford was educated and of a creative as well as Protestant reformist bent, publishing poems and hymns, serving as a correspondent for the paper The Congregationalist, and founding with her spouse the Industrial School for Girls in Middletown, Connecticut in 1868. In 1887 she became known for creating and directing a tableau based on the bestselling 1880 novel Ben Hur: A Tale of Christ to raise money for the homeopathetic hospital in Washington, D.C."

Such attire was adopted by some reform-minded, educated women of the middle and upper class (such as Bradford), mainly in the Northeastern U.S. as an alternative to long, heavy dresses underpinned by crinolines and tightly-laced corsets that typified women\u2019s fashion in the mid nineteenth century. Consisting of a dress or tunic over long pants, what became known as the Bloomer dress earned its name from temperance and women\u2019s rights activist Amelia Bloomer who donned and promoted it. It gained popularity in the 1850s but also drew the ire of critics who deemed the outfit unfeminine\u2014 \u201cpants\u201d for women\u2014likely due in part to the public, activist behavior of some of its wearers. Yet reformers looking to improve American society, often focusing on individuals and their personal habits, championed the outfit as comfortable and beneficial to women\u2019s health, allowing for freedom of breath and movement. This exercise suit, made of wool, would have been suitable for calisthenics and other activities outdoors, an important tenet of health reform, perhaps even during the winter in Massachusetts, where Bradford lived. Although chiefly utilitarian, it includes some stylistic details."

The actions of the horses--from chasing to catching the quarry--are also well illustrated. Noticeably, the background is rendered in the manner of the late Ming dynasty (1368-1644) landscape master Lan Ying (1585-ca. 1644), revealing an unusual combination of the men-and-horses genre and the later landscape tradition. This may suggest that at least two, if not more, artists collaborated on this painting."

The story given to Janett with the skirt was that it originally belonged to the \u201cmother\u2019s mother\u2019s grandmother\u2019s mother\u2019s mother\u201d who was enslaved in or near Macon, Georgia, or neighboring Jones County. Tracing back Mary Lizzie's maternal line, it is likely the skirt's second owner and wearer was her grandmother, a woman born as Mollie Johnson about 1862. Mollie Johnson Hunt\u2019s unidentified mother is the likely original maker and owner, though alterations consistent with the silhouette of the early to mid-1870s suggest Mollie may also have worn the skirt."

The skirt is made from cotton with a small-scale print in faded brown of a single flower surrounded by a stippled frame. Two bias brown tapes are machine stitched along the bottom with a pleated ruffle between them. The silhouette is flat in the front with a tightly gathered back waist and a center back closure with a hand sewn buttonhole and one (1) round black button. A loop of cotton string is tied through the buttonhole. An inset pocket with self-fabric lining is sewn at the proper right waist. The skirt is both hand and machine sewn, with later alterations being the machine stitched areas. The wide ruffled panel along the bottom of the skirt creates two layers along the bottom because it is sewn directly on top of the body of the skirt, with the same small floral print underneath the ruffle. A triangular shaped patch of faded blue cotton is hand sewn near the center front waist to add girth. The skirt has been taken up near the waist with a hand sewn tuck, which was sewn before the blue patch was added. The hem of both layers of fabric at the bottom is machine sewn."

This charming scene at the seashore reveals the technical versatility of Toyoharu's painting, ranging from the soft brushstrokes and ink washes depicting the landscape to the fluent rendering of the stylized waves. Rich, opaque color, meticulously applied and accented with gold, is restricted to the womens' fashionable kimonos. Toyoharu's mastery of expression is apparent in this lively work: the womens' garments seem to be caught by a breeze as they wade out to gather clams; the young woman deftly catches a fish with her hand."

The Bhagavata Purana relates that he emerged among the treasures thrown up by the turning of the sea, when the gods and demons worked together to churn the primordial ocean, thereby creating the entire universe. Dhanvantari appeared from the roiling waters bearing a jug filled with amrita, the nectar of immortality, as a gift for the gods. In more typical iconography, the sage holds the amrita jug and a conch shell signalling his affiliation with the god Vishnu. Here, however, Dhanvantari holds perhaps an air pump and a plant root."

From a renowned artistic family, Manaku was the son of Pandit Seu and the elder brother of Nainsukh. He was born in the small Pahari kingdom of Guler ca. 1700 and began receiving important commissions by around 1725. The small Bhagavata Purana was commissioned around 1740. Traditional Pahari painting features flattened figures bounded by a strong contour, set within intensely colored backgrounds, bordered by a narrow strip of sky at top and a strip of river at bottom. Manaku brought this regional style to its apex."

During her 28 years with the USFS she served in national forests all over the country. Most notably for this collection, she served in Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest in Washington state from 1980-1982, Cleveland National Forest in Southern California from 1982-1986, held a temporary assignment in Klamath National Forest in Northern California, and finally served in Ocala National Forest in central Florida from 1986-1987. From 1988 until her retirement in 2005 she served in the USFS headquarters in Washington, D.C. In the mid-1990s, Mobley was given a temporary detail to the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest in Nevada where she served as Deputy Forest Supervisor."

The motifs on the outer interlocking piece include kneeling hunchbacks holding tethered creatures. Hunchbacks are regarded as touched by the god Obatala who shapes the human form in the womb. White is the symbolic color of Obatala and may tie in with the use of ivory for this bracelet. The theme of ritual offerings is suggested by the disembodied heads within the interlocking circles of crocodiles biting the heads and tails of mudfish and by the tethered creatures. These creatures have been described as monkeys however they resemble Ofoe, the messenger of the god of death in the Benin Kingdom, who has no body only a head and arms and legs."

The dress is made from a peach twill silk and has a fitted bodice that ends at the natural waist. A band of self-fabric piping trims the scoop neckline. The sleeves are 3\/4 length and straight cut. A band of self-fabric decorative piping is sewn near the hem of the sleeves. The pencil skirt falls to the mid-calf and has a 5 1\/2-inch slit at the center back. The dress closes at the center back with a metal zipper painted peach to match the fabric, which extends from the neckline to the lower back. One (1) metal hook-and-eye is sewn above the zipper. The interior bodice and skirt of the dress are lined with a cream mesh synthetic fabric, while the sleeves are not lined. A length of peach thread is sewn at each interior top shoulder that can be closed with one (1) small metal snap each. The hem of the skirt is turned to the interior and edged with peach lace on the seam. The hem of the skirt lining is edged in cream lace. A white rectangular fabric label with plum embroidery reading \"L'Wren Scott\" is sewn at the interior proper left back side below the neckline."

This plant is a popular motif typically worn from August to mid-October. It has become a fashionable kimono design since used in a scene from the Tale of Genji. This plant is also associated with being strong. Floating among the bush clover are clouds covered with silhouettes of birds. Silk threads have been added to support the stencil structure."

Within twenty years after this painting was created, the balmy coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida had become fashionable tourist destinations. The hazy blue sky, palm trees, and golden sand suggest a romantic desert island where people could escape their everyday lives."

Below, the wall has a dado, above an entablature with a frieze which is decorated with festoons supported by knots, palmettes, and at the most prominent parts by displayed eagles. A line indicates the corner formed by the entrance wall and the one adjoining at right. The wall is covered with panels, which hold pictures. One and a half panels with pictures is visible (cut off on the right hand side). On both panels, the pictures are arranged in similar fashion. The three paintings in the middle row depict, from top to bottom, a scene of sacrifice, landscape, and dance. Corner pictures are in oval shape and they depict architectural structures. Four small panels between them show figures in costumes. Above the door is a landscape."

The crown is rounder than a typical pillbox and is slightly pointed at the top of the crown. A decorative side band of rust toned satin has been secured around circumference of the hat with adhesive. This band comes to a \u201cV\u201d shape at center front. Three strands of the same shiny raffia braid used for the hat body are adhered to the center of the satin band, following the same \u201cV\u201d shape at center front. The satin has been applied over a stiff foundation, possibly cardboard, and is joined at the center back where it overlaps and is adhered together. A grey diamond patterned nylon net veil is applied at center of the crown and drapes down over the entire hat. The veil is tacked to the crown with stitching, and a seam runs down to center back where it is tacked again with hand stitching at the bottom edge. A grey petersham rayon ribbon band has been machine stitched to hat's interior. A paper covered metal wire is zig zag stitched to edge of the hat where it is turned up under the petersham ribbon. The hat is unlined. There is a label stitched at the center back of the hat that reads [Jellef\u2019s]."

The skirt is made of pale pink satin and is cut full and round, with slightly more structure at the hips and back. A panel of pale pink organza, decorated with the same sequin paillettes as the bodice, runs down the center front of the skirt from the waist to the hem. The dress closes in the back with a zipper that runs from the top of the center back bodice to the center back below the waist. There is one (1) hook-and-eye closure at the top of the zipper. Three (3) small bows are stitched just to the proper right side of the zipper, covering the zipper when closed. A small metal snap is sewn onto the two (2) bright pink bands so that they close over the bottom of the zipper."

The skirt is floor length with a slightly ruffling hem. The dress consists of an under dress made of ivory silk faille with a thin covering of white tulle, including a thicker ruffled tulle section at the bottom of the skirt. It is hidden from the exterior by an over dress made of ivory floral net lace with ivory satin accents. It mirrors the shaping of the under dress, but is slightly longer. The lace is embellished with trim made from thin short strips of iridescent white plastic attached at the middle to white thread, with the thread sewn onto the lace outlining the floral design of the lace. The lace extends beyond the under dress around the neckline and onto the shoulder straps and upper back where it is only backed with white tulle, with the edge cut in a scallop outlining the neck and arm openings. An ivory satin ribbon is wrapped around the waistline. A band of ivory silk satin is sewn on the skirt in a diagonal that begins at the hip of the proper left side and then extends downward across the skirt near the hem of the proper right side, bisecting the lace portions of the skirt. The satin band is continuous around the front and back of the skirt. Pieces of the trim-embellished floral lace are cut so that floral elements extend onto the sides of the satin band. Two wide satin streamers are pleated and sewn at the proper left back, one at the top of the satin band and the other at the waist underneath the ribbon waistband. The top streamer reaches nearly to the hemline of the skirt, the bottom streamer extends slightly beyond the skirt hem. The dress closes at the center back with a zipper and one (1) hook-and-eye. The waist band closes separately at the center back on top of the zipper with one (1) metal snap."

The wrap effect is achieved by crossing the front bodice at the waist seam and gathered fabric on the proper left side of the waist. The skirt is flaired with six (6) gores and three pleats in the skirt at the center front add further to the wrap effect. The set-in full length sleeves are gathered at a 1 1\/4\" cuff that closes with two metal snaps. The dress has a small shawl collar and a v-neck. The dress closes at the proper left side waist with a zipper. It is unlined, and the seams are pressed open with raw edges exposed. It is machine-sewn except for the hem, which is turned up 2 inches and hand stitched. There are two belt loops made of a thin yellow braid, one at each side seam, which hold the accompanying belt (b) in place."

The skirt of the dress has a flat front, and the skirt gathers toward the center-back waist with box pleats to create a small bustle silhouette. Green silk vines and leaves, covered in two-toned pink rose blooms and buds, begin at each front shoulder above the bust, cover both shoulders, and run along the edges of the open back bodice to the center back. On the proper right side, one (1) small vine continues below the waist and wraps around the hip to the front of the skirt. On the proper left side, two (2) longer vines continue below the waist and wrap around to the front of the skirt, the longest ending just above the hemline and wrapping all the way around to the proper right front. The dress closes up the center back with a silver zipper that begins below the center back waist and ends above the waist. Two (2) large roses in full bloom are attached at the center back waist."

It is made from the border section of a sari featuring heavy metallic brocade in a geometric design, with the embroidered leaves from a sari border fussy cut from the fabric and sewn around the waist line, the bottom edges left loose to create a three-dimensional detail. The floor-length skirt has a flat front and is slightly gathered at the back. It is made from a sari that has an all-over design of metallic brocaded stylized leaves scattered at wide intervals with blank spaces between them. The edge of the skirt hem is trimmed in a sari border with a stylized floral and geometric metallic brocade design. Individual small metallic brocade leaves fussy cut from a larger sari fabric are sewn onto the skirt near the larger brocaded leaves of the skirt fabric. The dress closes at the center back with a zipper and one (1) metal hook-and-eye. Attached along the back top edge of the bodice is a panel of the same sari fabric used on the skirt that is separate from the back of the dress, extending down to meet the hemline of the skirt. The panel is gathered and seamed along the top edge of the bodice, with a slit cut in the back bodice corresponding to the zipper closure of the dress underneath. This slit is fastened shut with two (2) metal hooks into thread loops. The side and bottom edges of the panel are trimmed in the same sari border used to trim the skirt hem. Pre-tied bows with short tails made from the sari border are sewn at each back shoulder over the top corner seams of the back panel."

The main fabric is a plain weave natural fiber fabric with a cream ground and a repeating pattern of small four-petal flowers in red, purple, blue, and tan. The skirt is predominantly hand-sewn. It has a waistband made from an undyed bast fiber fabric with the floral print gathered and whip stitched to the waistband. The skirt is more closely gathered on the back. There is a slit at the center back that divides the waistband completely. There is no attached closure method, but rust staining at the back opening of the waistband suggests the skirt was pinned to close. The bottom of the skirt has an extra flounce of the floral print that has a series of pleats around the skirt in sets of three alternating with straight sections. This flounce is machine-sewn at the top and 1 1\/2 inches from the bottom using blue thread that is possibly a synthetic fiber. The bottom and top edges of the flounce are bound with blue fabric sewn on the bias. The interior of the skirt is lined only behind the extra flounce with a hand-pinked undyed bast fiber fabric. There is a previous repair on the back proper right side of the skirt where a panel of light brown synthetic fabric is hand sewn on the interior of the skirt from the gathering at the waist to the top of the older linen lining on the bottom."
