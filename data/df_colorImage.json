The device on the buttons and the metal insignia at center front is a hammer (proper right) crossing over a chisel (proper left). The background of the metal insignia is blue and red-and-white striped silk encircled first by a blue silk border and then a brassy \u2018rope\u2019. Two bands that appear to consist of silver-plated plaiting encircle the cap: one at the top ridge and one around the side of the cap just below the middle. A third band of tripartite gold-colored metal-wrapped cording encircles the cap at the base of the side, extending over the brim. The interior of the cap is lined with cardboard on the inner side walls and covered with a cotton tabby outer lining. The roof interior is leather, probably Moroccan leather."

The lower strap is stitched to the edges of the toe box and joins to meet in the middle. The lower strap is stitched to the upper strap at the anterior ankle. The upper strap is suede elastic, and loops around the wearer's ankle from one edge of the heel to the other. The shoes have a 3 inch stilletto heel that is covered with suede and tipped with black rubber. There is a manufacturer's tag on the insole on both shoes, white with black stitching: \"VIA SPIGA \/ MADE IN \/ ITALY\". On the tags are hand-written the letter \"T\" indicating that the shoes were worn by Terry Ellis. On the underside of both shoes at the shank are the leather seal and size \"VERO \/ CUOIO \/ MADE IN ITALY \/ 4 5 \/ 8B\"."

They date back to the 17th century but were most actively in use during the 18th and 19th century. These pencas were first associated with \u201cfor profit slaves\u201d, enslaved people who worked for wages in urban Brazilian cities. While these people were forced to pay most of their earnings to slave owners, they were able to retain the remainder of their wages. Enslaved and freed Afro-Brazilians used their wages to purchase jewelry like this from local artisans as a means of cultural expression, spiritual protection, and wealth storage. These objects were extremely valuable, often written into wills as key asset to be adjudicated. The fastener and the charms were crafted out of gold or silver and were worn around the waist or on the wrist."

Syncretic ornaments, Penca de Balangand\u00e3 merge values and aesthetics of baroque Catholicism and traditional African practices. Many of the charms carry dual meanings of Catholic symbolism and Afro-Brazillian orixas. The charms were curated by their individual owner to have specific aspects of spiritual protection. They were often called \u201cpenca\u201d meaning bouquet, as the charms are closely grouped together, and \u201cBalangand\u00e3\u201d, an onomatopoetic word for the sound of the charms clinking together. While these ornaments were traditionally made of metal, they also included pieces of bone, coral, wood and stone to add to ornamentation."

The two birds engraved into the clasp may represent Africa and the Americas, with the shape of the clasp symbolizing the slave ship that transported enslaved Africans across the Atlantic. Within the candombl\u00e9 faith, grapes represent the orisha Oxum and are also symbols of female fertility, passion, and life. Fish is also a symbol of fertility and a representation of the orisha Lemanj\u00e1. The pineapple and mandarin generally represent fertility of the land while the cashew apple represents the orisha Xango and is a symbol of vitality. The tusk is an object of superstition, and the dark wood of the figa (wooden hand) possibly indicates a stronger protection against the evil eye. The figa itself represents sexuality and fertility to attract positive energy and reproduction. The cylinder is used to store herbs and other pieces of wood. These bundles were meant to protect against back luck. It might have been used to hold incense."

He was accompanied by a young French artist named Ernest Delannoy. This comic sketch shows the artists arriving in the fashionable resort town of Baden-Baden, where their rough clothes and bohemian airs disrupted the idyll of bourgeois self-satisfaction. The drawing is on a double sheet of paper that has been removed from a sketchbook-leaving stitching holes down the middle of the image."

Ellen Jane Knight, known familiarly as \u201cNellie,\u201d was the niece of Massachusetts lieutenant governor Horatio Gates Knight, and lived in his household after her mother died. She graduated from Williston Seminary (now the Williston Northampton School), a co-educational academy, and taught music. In 1865 she married James Henry Bradford, who served as a chaplain in the Union Army before becoming a Congregational minister. They lived in various places in the northeast, usually pursuing work in education, and moved to Washington, D.C. in 1881. Ellen Bradford was educated and of a creative as well as Protestant reformist bent, publishing poems and hymns, serving as a correspondent for the paper The Congregationalist, and founding with her spouse the Industrial School for Girls in Middletown, Connecticut in 1868. In 1887 she became known for creating and directing a tableau based on the bestselling 1880 novel Ben Hur: A Tale of Christ to raise money for the homeopathetic hospital in Washington, D.C."

Such attire was adopted by some reform-minded, educated women of the middle and upper class (such as Bradford), mainly in the Northeastern U.S. as an alternative to long, heavy dresses underpinned by crinolines and tightly-laced corsets that typified women\u2019s fashion in the mid nineteenth century. Consisting of a dress or tunic over long pants, what became known as the Bloomer dress earned its name from temperance and women\u2019s rights activist Amelia Bloomer who donned and promoted it. It gained popularity in the 1850s but also drew the ire of critics who deemed the outfit unfeminine\u2014 \u201cpants\u201d for women\u2014likely due in part to the public, activist behavior of some of its wearers. Yet reformers looking to improve American society, often focusing on individuals and their personal habits, championed the outfit as comfortable and beneficial to women\u2019s health, allowing for freedom of breath and movement. This exercise suit, made of wool, would have been suitable for calisthenics and other activities outdoors, an important tenet of health reform, perhaps even during the winter in Massachusetts, where Bradford lived. Although chiefly utilitarian, it includes some stylistic details."

The actions of the horses--from chasing to catching the quarry--are also well illustrated. Noticeably, the background is rendered in the manner of the late Ming dynasty (1368-1644) landscape master Lan Ying (1585-ca. 1644), revealing an unusual combination of the men-and-horses genre and the later landscape tradition. This may suggest that at least two, if not more, artists collaborated on this painting."

Tracing back Mary Lizzie's maternal line, it is likely the skirt's second owner and wearer was her grandmother, a woman born as Mollie Johnson about 1862. Mollie Johnson Hunt\u2019s unidentified mother is the likely original maker and owner, though alterations consistent with the silhouette of the early to mid-1870s suggest Mollie may also have worn the skirt."

The skirt is made from cotton with a small-scale print in faded brown of a single flower surrounded by a stippled frame. Two bias brown tapes are machine stitched along the bottom with a pleated ruffle between them. The silhouette is flat in the front with a tightly gathered back waist and a center back closure with a hand sewn buttonhole and one (1) round black button. A loop of cotton string is tied through the buttonhole. An inset pocket with self-fabric lining is sewn at the proper right waist. The skirt is both hand and machine sewn, with later alterations being the machine stitched areas. The wide ruffled panel along the bottom of the skirt creates two layers along the bottom because it is sewn directly on top of the body of the skirt, with the same small floral print underneath the ruffle. A triangular shaped patch of faded blue cotton is hand sewn near the center front waist to add girth. The skirt has been taken up near the waist with a hand sewn tuck, which was sewn before the blue patch was added. The hem of both layers of fabric at the bottom is machine sewn."

                "content":"This hat box belonged to journalist Ethel L. Payne (1911-1991), who filed reports from thirty countries in her pioneering career. The blue, circular case has a zippered, hard shell to protect a hat or wig inside. The fabric-lined interior has a pocket and ribbons to secure objects. A label on the pocket identifies the model and make as CarryAll by Munro, an American shoe and luggage company. Outside, brass rings secure a translucent handle. The train case, as it is also known, can stand vertically on four metal knobs. Additional testimony to Payne\u2019s extensive travel include a North American Van Lines sticker and a paper tag for an Eastern Airlines flight on December 22, 1976 bound for Washington, DC, where Payne covered national and international news for the Chicago Defender. Hat boxes were common in the mid-twentieth century, as hats were essential wardrobe elements. Payne, in particular, chose hats to accent her fashionable attire. Hats might have further distinguished the first African American female member of the White House Press Corps from male colleagues, who removed them while indoors. However, Payne commanded presidential recognition at press conferences entirely on her own moxie."

When Whistler exhibited it at the Dowdeswells' gallery in 1884, unsympathetic reviewers complained that paintings like this were mere daubs, dismissing such efforts as unfinished sketches not fit for public display. The fashion writer for the Court Circular damned The Angry Sea with ironic praise, noting that \"this wonderful artist uses frames of greenish gold wherever the picture requires such a setting. A strip of angry grey-green sea, framed in green gold, against dull pink background [the color of the gallery walls] is an exquisite arrangement of colour.\""

This charming scene at the seashore reveals the technical versatility of Toyoharu's painting, ranging from the soft brushstrokes and ink washes depicting the landscape to the fluent rendering of the stylized waves. Rich, opaque color, meticulously applied and accented with gold, is restricted to the womens' fashionable kimonos. Toyoharu's mastery of expression is apparent in this lively work: the womens' garments seem to be caught by a breeze as they wade out to gather clams; the young woman deftly catches a fish with her hand."

Dhanvantari appeared from the roiling waters bearing a jug filled with amrita, the nectar of immortality, as a gift for the gods. In more typical iconography, the sage holds the amrita jug and a conch shell signalling his affiliation with the god Vishnu. Here, however, Dhanvantari holds perhaps an air pump and a plant root."

Traditional Pahari painting features flattened figures bounded by a strong contour, set within intensely colored backgrounds, bordered by a narrow strip of sky at top and a strip of river at bottom.

It belonged to a Founding Father, Benjamin Franklin, and is thought to have been made in France around 1778, the year the Treaty of Alliance between the United States and France was signed. Franklin, the American Minister to France from 1776 until 1785, was a key figure in Franco-American politics and often present at the court of King Louis XVI. This plain suit would have created a stark visual contrast between Franklin and those in the elaborate dress commonplace for the opulent French Court."

She also was the first African American woman to graduate (in 1979) from the University of Washington College of Forest Resources (later renamed the School of Forest Resources in the College of the Environment). During her 28 years with the USFS she served in national forests all over the country. Most notably for this collection, she served in Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest in Washington state from 1980-1982, Cleveland National Forest in Southern California from 1982-1986, held a temporary assignment in Klamath National Forest in Northern California, and finally served in Ocala National Forest in central Florida from 1986-1987. From 1988 until her retirement in 2005 she served in the USFS headquarters in Washington, D.C. In the mid-1990s, Mobley was given a temporary detail to the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest in Nevada where she served as Deputy Forest Supervisor."

The motifs on the outer interlocking piece include kneeling hunchbacks holding tethered creatures. Hunchbacks are regarded as touched by the god Obatala who shapes the human form in the womb. White is the symbolic color of Obatala and may tie in with the use of ivory for this bracelet. The theme of ritual offerings is suggested by the disembodied heads within the interlocking circles of crocodiles biting the heads and tails of mudfish and by the tethered creatures. These creatures have been described as monkeys however they resemble Ofoe, the messenger of the god of death in the Benin Kingdom, who has no body only a head and arms and legs."

Theodore Duret reported that Whistler was particularly struck by Rembrandt's Portrait of a Man in a Beret in the Louvre. Whistler adopted Rembrandt's general format as well as his rich, dark palette. The artist Kenyon Cox detected the impact of Courbet's realism in Whistler's use of \"rather violent light and shade, with black shadows, the yellowish tone of the flesh, and the attempt at powerful modelling.\" The self-portrait exhibits a fastidious fashion consciousness: the artist is wearing a flat-brimmed brushed silk hat--the \"Quartier Latin type,\" as one friend described it. By the time Freer acquired this self-portrait in 1906, it had been frequently exhibited in America and reproduced as both a woodcut and an engraving."

Ann\u2019s brother, Oliver Hazard Perry, was but one of many decorated officers in the family. Her husband\u2019s family also owned what is now the historic Rodgers Tavern in Perryville, Maryland. Conservation of this miniature was made possible through a generous grant provided by the Smithsonian Women\u2019s Committee."

Joseph Palmer, of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, wore a beard in 1830 and was publicly criticized for what was then considered a violation of propriety.

Her fashionable hat, flowing black veil, and dramatic red lips and scarf clearly place her in the 1940s. The strong outlines of her face and jacket suggest a self-assured, modern woman. One of America\u2019s foremost modernist artists, Stella retained strong ties to his Italian roots as well as to the traditions of the old masters. Even when drawing his friends, he preferred a strict profile view, reminiscent of the early Italian Renaissance tradition."

Despite these difficult circumstances, Bannister established himself by tapping into the market for pastoral landscape scenes, fashionable among wealthy Providence patrons. Dealer Seth M.

Cox advocated the nude as an artistic subject but was often criticized because his nudes looked too familiar. For example, in this image the woman gazes into a nineteenth-century silver mirror, wears a fashionable pompadour hairstyle, and sits in a turn-of-the-century domestic interior with contemporary wallpaper. Cox based his treatment of the subject on classical and Renaissance models, but he was always mindful of keeping up with the times. He wanted his nudes to have \"real flesh and bodily appearance\" so they would appeal to modern tastes. (Morgan, Kenyon Cox, 1856-1919: A Life in American Art, 1994)"

Cox copied an Egyptian portrait and, following the fashion for trompe l\u2019oeil, or \u201cfool the eye\u201d painting, he created the illusion of paper tacked onto the sculpture\u2019s base.

While the subject of women lost in reverie was fashionable at the turn of the twentieth century, most artists chose to idealize their sitters. Eakins, on the other hand, did not disguise their blemishes and \u201cworry lines,\u201d and many people considered his portraits to be unflattering.

In a letter to his mother-in-law, Morgan praised his wife as \u201can excellent companion at all times . . . full of spirits.\u201d In this portrait, Mary holds a mandolin, a fashionable instrument for aristocratic ladies. She wears a lavish pink satin gown with a sable collar and pearls that adorn her sleeves and hair. This outfit was not typical dress for colonial women, but was invented by the artist to conjure eighteenth-century European tastes for all things related to the \u201cOrient.\u201d (Reinhardt, \u201cThe Work of Fancy and Taste,\u201d Dress, vol. 29, 2002) Benjamin West painted this portrait from a miniature of Mary that her husband brought with him during his visit to London in 1764."

Jacob Eichholtz's painting accurately depicts Buchanan, who often wore black suits and large white cravats. The future president appears composed and confident, but his slightly uneven eyes give him an intimidating stare. The portrait was owned by Buchanan and then given to his niece, Harriet Lane Johnston, who served as his official hostess at the White House during his administration."

The inner garment, which is like a slip or frock, is entire in one piece, and beautifully ornamented with embroidery and beads, with a row of elks' teeth passing across the breast, and a robe of the young buffalo's skin, tastefully and elaborately embroidered, gracefully thrown over her shoulders, and hanging down to the ground behind her.\u201d Catlin painted fewer women than men, a fact explained by their secondary place in Indian society. As the young daughter of an Arikara chief, however, Sweet-scented Grass possessed status in the tribe and the means to dress in \u201ca robe of the young buffalo\u2019s skin, tastefully and elaborately embroidered\u201d in northern Plains style. Catlin painted this portrait at an Arikara village in 1832.

A line indicates the corner formed by the entrance wall and the one adjoining at right. The wall is covered with panels, which hold pictures. One and a half panels with pictures is visible (cut off on the right hand side). On both panels, the pictures are arranged in similar fashion. The three paintings in the middle row depict, from top to bottom, a scene of sacrifice, landscape, and dance. Corner pictures are in oval shape and they depict architectural structures.

They are, like all other Indian women, the slaves of their husbands: being obliged to perform all the domestic duties and drudgeries of the tribe, and not allowed to join in their religious rites or ceremonies, nor in the dance or other amusements . . . The Crow and Blackfeet women, like all others I ever saw in any Indian tribe, divide the hair on the forehead, and paint the separation or crease with vermilion or red earth.

The base of the hat is made of light green synthetic taffeta with six machine stitched darts that meet at the top of the crown. The center back dart transitions into a seam that extends to the edge of the hat. Excess fabric from the dart fold is tacked down with adhesive to the crown forming the base for the flowers. Orange and yellow flowers and dark yellow leaves are glued to the hat's exterior which cover most of the visible surface area of green taffeta. Each flower is made of three to four layers of silk organza, blended silk synthetic and glued to the hat's exterior. A circle of synthetic green velvet is glued to the center of each flower. Sheer dark yellow silk chiffon is used to make long leaf shapes at the sides of hat. The interior of the hat is unlined. The raw edge of the green taffeta is folded, and machine stitched to exterior. Cording possibly made of elastic is encased in the rolled hem at the bottom of the hat."

Flowers made of silk organza and possibly a silk synthetic blend are hand tacked to the surface of the crown, hiding the base fabric. The flowers are layered over each other, with the silk synthetic blend pieces on the bottom and the lighter organza pieces on top. Pistils made of synthetic fiber and white coating have been pulled through the center of the flowers, their ends are secured with floral tape to create a stem. The flowers are blue, white, and yellow, though substantial dye bleed has occurred, and the colors have blended. The hat band is made of green straw braid and is machine stitched to the crown. The hat is fully lined in bias-cut rayon faille with a small scale pink rose print. The lining is hand stitched along the hat band with green cotton thread. Black elastic cord with metal barbs is secured through two holes in the lining on the sides of the hat. The hat has a detached white woven fabric label (b) that reads [FASHIONED BY \/\/ Ronnie] in black text with an orange border."

The edge of the cap is folded up, creating a short brim. Two red, orange, and yellow fabric roses are attached to the front of the crown. Both roses are made of velveteen and satin petals with paper covered wire stems that have been coated in a green plastic or wax coating. The flower petals are secured to each other with adhesive and stitched to the hat. Stems have also been secured to hat with individual tacking stitches. Two smaller buds extend from underneath both roses and protrude slightly beyond the edge of hat. Leaves made from velveteen with wire stems are also attached the beneath roses. The underside of the velveteen leaves and petals are possibly stabilized with heat-fusible interfacing. Bias-cut strips of straw braid are attached at the sides of the hat to form decorative loops that are secured inside the hat with tacking stitches. Behind these loops are thick wire grips that have been covered with tan petersham ribbon. The grips are constructed with a continuous length of wire that is attached along the circumference of the hat's interior and formed into upside down heart shapes at each side. A brown petersham ribbon sweatband is machine sewn along bottom edge at the interior, concealing the raw edge of the straw braid. Paper covered metal wire is zig zag stitched to edge of straw braid for further shaping."

Three strands of the same shiny raffia braid used for the hat body are adhered to the center of the satin band, following the same \u201cV\u201d shape at center front. The satin has been applied over a stiff foundation, possibly cardboard, and is joined at the center back where it overlaps and is adhered together. A grey diamond patterned nylon net veil is applied at center of the crown and drapes down over the entire hat. The veil is tacked to the crown with stitching, and a seam runs down to center back where it is tacked again with hand stitching at the bottom edge. A grey petersham rayon ribbon band has been machine stitched to hat's interior. A paper covered metal wire is zig zag stitched to edge of the hat where it is turned up under the petersham ribbon.

The crown is short, fitting close to the top of the head. The synthetic raffia continues to the base of the crown and then slopes upwards and back down to create the brim, which is the same height of the crown. The edge of the brim is folded inwards which gives the brim rounded edges. A cream petersham rayon ribbon is adhered to the raffia on the brim at the proper right. The ribbon is tucked under to create the illusion that it has been interwoven with the raffia. The same ribbon creates a flower shape that is made of three concentric loops that are adhered to keep their shape. The brim is turned under at bottom edge and a cream petersham ribbon sweatband is machine sewn overtop. A strip of buckram encases a paper covered metal wire under the inner band at the raw edge of the synthetic raffia. A woven cream label is stitched to the interior center back of the hat that reads [John Wanamaker]."

A bow made of the same petersham ribbon is adhered to the center back of the hatband. The brim is asymmetrical and is flipped upwards towards the crown on the proper right side. The edge of the brim is finished with a thin navy petersham rayon ribbon. A bow made of the same petersham ribbon is adhered to the center front of the brim. The interior of the hat is unlined.

A panel of the taffeta is gathered and pleated to form the shoulder strap, which is attached at the proper left front bodice under a vertical strip of the taffeta that also serves to gather up a separate panel of pleated taffeta that is attached around the top edge of the bodice. A pre-tied self-fabric bow lined in chartreuse taffeta is sewn at the center back of the shoulder strap, which attaches to the center back of the bodice with two (2) hooks corresponding to eyes on either back side of the bodice. The waistband of the dress is made from a wide pleated piece of the yellow taffeta with an over-sized pre-tied bow attached at the proper left front side. The bow has long tails, with the loops and tails lined in the chartreuse taffeta. The skirt is pleated around the waistband for fullness. The bottom ten (10) inches of the skirt is lined with the chartreuse, which shows on the facing side within the cascading folds of the asymmetric skirt.

At the upper bust, pale pink organza gathers to cover the d\u00e9colletage, which is decorated with cream and pale pink sequin paillettes. There is a band of bright pink satin below the organza d\u00e9colletage that continues around both sides of the bodice to gather at the center back, on either side of the zipper. This bright pink satin band continues running down the back of the skirt all the way to the hemline, creating two (2) streamers. The skirt is made of pale pink satin and is cut full and round, with slightly more structure at the hips and back. A panel of pale pink organza, decorated with the same sequin paillettes as the bodice, runs down the center front of the skirt from the waist to the hem. The dress closes in the back with a zipper that runs from the top of the center back bodice to the center back below the waist. There is one (1) hook-and-eye closure at the top of the zipper. Three (3) small bows are stitched just to the proper right side of the zipper, covering the zipper when closed. A small metal snap is sewn onto the two (2) bright pink bands so that they close over the bottom of the zipper."

A wider elastic band is tacked at the center front and closes in the center back with two hook-and-eyes to provide further bust support. An interior waistband of cream grosgrain ribbon is tacked to the interior waistline and closes at the center back. The skirt interior has two petticoats and a bustle. The innermost petticoat is made of a pale pink taffeta lined with stiff linen and hemmed with ruched pink tulle. This petticoat attaches to the waist at the center back with a hook-and-eye. The next layer of the underskirt is a pink net bustle attached along the back of the skirt. The final layer of the underskirt is the outermost petticoat, which is made of pale pink organza and has an attached ruffled hem.

The skirt is floor length with a slightly ruffling hem. The dress consists of an under dress made of ivory silk faille with a thin covering of white tulle, including a thicker ruffled tulle section at the bottom of the skirt. It is hidden from the exterior by an over dress made of ivory floral net lace with ivory satin accents. It mirrors the shaping of the under dress, but is slightly longer. The lace is embellished with trim made from thin short strips of iridescent white plastic attached at the middle to white thread, with the thread sewn onto the lace outlining the floral design of the lace. The lace extends beyond the under dress around the neckline and onto the shoulder straps and upper back where it is only backed with white tulle, with the edge cut in a scallop outlining the neck and arm openings. An ivory satin ribbon is wrapped around the waistline. A band of ivory silk satin is sewn on the skirt in a diagonal that begins at the hip of the proper left side and then extends downward across the skirt near the hem of the proper right side, bisecting the lace portions of the skirt. The satin band is continuous around the front and back of the skirt. Pieces of the trim-embellished floral lace are cut so that floral elements extend onto the sides of the satin band. Two wide satin streamers are pleated and sewn at the proper left back, one at the top of the satin band and the other at the waist underneath the ribbon waistband. The top streamer reaches nearly to the hemline of the skirt, the bottom streamer extends slightly beyond the skirt hem. The dress closes at the center back with a zipper and one (1) hook-and-eye. The waist band closes separately at the center back on top of the zipper with one (1) metal snap."

A pink silk organza hat band is draped around the base of the crown and tacked down with hand stitches. Blue feathers are pinned to the exterior of the hat and wrapped with thread at the base. A pink fabric rose with a yellow felt pompom glued to the center is pinned under the feathers. The fabric petals are made of polyester silk and velveteen with raw edges.

The skirt of the dress has a flat front, and the skirt gathers toward the center-back waist with box pleats to create a small bustle silhouette. Green silk vines and leaves, covered in two-toned pink rose blooms and buds, begin at each front shoulder above the bust, cover both shoulders, and run along the edges of the open back bodice to the center back. On the proper right side, one (1) small vine continues below the waist and wraps around the hip to the front of the skirt. On the proper left side, two (2) longer vines continue below the waist and wrap around to the front of the skirt, the longest ending just above the hemline and wrapping all the way around to the proper right front.

It is made from the border section of a sari featuring heavy metallic brocade in a geometric design, with the embroidered leaves from a sari border fussy cut from the fabric and sewn around the waist line, the bottom edges left loose to create a three-dimensional detail. The floor-length skirt has a flat front and is slightly gathered at the back. It is made from a sari that has an all-over design of metallic brocaded stylized leaves scattered at wide intervals with blank spaces between them. The edge of the skirt hem is trimmed in a sari border with a stylized floral and geometric metallic brocade design. Individual small metallic brocade leaves fussy cut from a larger sari fabric are sewn onto the skirt near the larger brocaded leaves of the skirt fabric. The dress closes at the center back with a zipper and one (1) metal hook-and-eye. Attached along the back top edge of the bodice is a panel of the same sari fabric used on the skirt that is separate from the back of the dress, extending down to meet the hemline of the skirt. The panel is gathered and seamed along the top edge of the bodice, with a slit cut in the back bodice corresponding to the zipper closure of the dress underneath. This slit is fastened shut with two (2) metal hooks into thread loops. The side and bottom edges of the panel are trimmed in the same sari border used to trim the skirt hem. Pre-tied bows with short tails made from the sari border are sewn at each back shoulder over the top corner seams of the back panel."

The main fabric is a plain weave natural fiber fabric with a cream ground and a repeating pattern of small four-petal flowers in red, purple, blue, and tan. The skirt is predominantly hand-sewn. It has a waistband made from an undyed bast fiber fabric with the floral print gathered and whip stitched to the waistband. The skirt is more closely gathered on the back. There is a slit at the center back that divides the waistband completely. There is no attached closure method, but rust staining at the back opening of the waistband suggests the skirt was pinned to close. The bottom of the skirt has an extra flounce of the floral print that has a series of pleats around the skirt in sets of three alternating with straight sections. This flounce is machine-sewn at the top and 1 1\/2 inches from the bottom using blue thread that is possibly a synthetic fiber. The bottom and top edges of the flounce are bound with blue fabric sewn on the bias. The interior of the skirt is lined only behind the extra flounce with a hand-pinked undyed bast fiber fabric. There is a previous repair on the back proper right side of the skirt where a panel of light brown synthetic fabric is hand sewn on the interior of the skirt from the gathering at the waist to the top of the older linen lining on the bottom."

Gernreich, born in Austria in 1922, emigrated to the U.S. with his mother in 1938, fleeing Nazi persecution of Jews and settling in Los Angeles. Along with his then-partner, activist Harry Hay and others, he was a founding member of the Mattachine Society, an early LGBTQ\/gay rights organization, around 1950. Gernreich first worked as a dancer and in costume design in Los Angeles, eventually becoming known for avant-garde fashion designs. Many of his clothes were \u201cunisex,\u201d intended for men and women alike, as he sought to detach clothing from gender\u2014designing skirts for men, pants for women\u2014and remove the stigma of nudity. His body conscious and often minimalist designs can be interpreted as celebrations of the body and statements against sexual repression."

The yards of expensive fabric and silk ribbons in the costume testified to George Watson's success as an importer of European goods, as did the fact that he could afford to commission a portrait from Boston's foremost painter. Mrs. Watson showed herself to colonial society as a fashionable English matron, but her direct gaze suggests the grit and character of a new American society that would emerge within ten years."
