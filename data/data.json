They date back to the 17th century but were most actively in use during the 18th and 19th century. These pencas were first associated with “for profit slaves”, enslaved people who worked for wages in urban Brazilian cities. While these people were forced to pay most of their earnings to slave owners, they were able to retain the remainder of their wages. Enslaved and freed Afro-Brazilians used their wages to purchase jewelry like this from local artisans as a means of cultural expression, spiritual protection, and wealth storage. These objects were extremely valuable, often written into wills as key asset to be adjudicated. The fastener and the charms were crafted out of gold or silver and were worn around the waist or on the wrist."},{"label":"Caption","content":"These charms are also associated with celebrations of Black brother/sisterhoods and can be worn in religious celebration. Syncretic ornaments, Penca de Balangandã merge values and aesthetics of baroque Catholicism and traditional African practices. Many of the charms carry dual meanings of Catholic symbolism and Afro-Brazillian orixas. The charms were curated by their individual owner to have specific aspects of spiritual protection. They were often called “penca” meaning bouquet, as the charms are closely grouped together, and “Balangandã”, an onomatopoetic word for the sound of the charms clinking together. While these ornaments were traditionally made of metal, they also included pieces of bone, coral, wood and stone to add to ornamentation."},{"label":"Caption","content":"The pendant charms on this penca may have multiple meanings. The two birds engraved into the clasp may represent Africa and the Americas, with the shape of the clasp symbolizing the slave ship that transported enslaved Africans across the Atlantic. Within the candomblé faith, grapes represent the orisha Oxum and are also symbols of female fertility, passion, and life. Fish is also a symbol of fertility and a representation of the orisha Lemanjá. The pineapple and mandarin generally represent fertility of the land while the cashew apple represents the orisha Xango and is a symbol of vitality. The tusk is an object of superstition, and the dark wood of the figa (wooden hand) possibly indicates a stronger protection against the evil eye. The figa itself represents sexuality and fertility to attract positive energy and reproduction. The cylinder is used to store herbs and other pieces of wood. These bundles were meant to protect against back luck.

Ellen Jane Knight, known familiarly as “Nellie,” was the niece of Massachusetts lieutenant governor Horatio Gates Knight, and lived in his household after her mother died. She graduated from Williston Seminary (now the Williston Northampton School), a co-educational academy, and taught music. In 1865 she married James Henry Bradford, who served as a chaplain in the Union Army before becoming a Congregational minister. They lived in various places in the northeast, usually pursuing work in education, and moved to Washington, D.C. in 1881. Ellen Bradford was educated and of a creative as well as Protestant reformist bent, publishing poems and hymns, serving as a correspondent for the paper The Congregationalist, and founding with her spouse the Industrial School for Girls in Middletown, Connecticut in 1868. In 1887 she became known for creating and directing a tableau based on the bestselling 1880 novel Ben Hur: A Tale of Christ to raise money for the homeopathetic hospital in Washington, D.C."},{"label":"Description","content":"Bradford likely wore this exercise suit in the early 1860s, perhaps before she married. Such attire was adopted by some reform-minded, educated women of the middle and upper class (such as Bradford), mainly in the Northeastern U.S. as an alternative to long, heavy dresses underpinned by crinolines and tightly-laced corsets that typified women’s fashion in the mid nineteenth century. Consisting of a dress or tunic over long pants, what became known as the Bloomer dress earned its name from temperance and women’s rights activist Amelia Bloomer who donned and promoted it. It gained popularity in the 1850s but also drew the ire of critics who deemed the outfit unfeminine— “pants” for women—likely due in part to the public, activist behavior of some of its wearers. Yet reformers looking to improve American society, often focusing on individuals and their personal habits, championed the outfit as comfortable and beneficial to women’s health, allowing for freedom of breath and movement. This exercise suit, made of wool, would have been suitable for calisthenics and other activities outdoors, an important tenet of health reform, perhaps even during the winter in Massachusetts, where Bradford lived.

They are, like all other Indian women, the slaves of their husbands: being obliged to perform all the domestic duties and drudgeries of the tribe, and not allowed to join in their religious rites or ceremonies, nor in the dance or other amusements . . . The Crow and Blackfeet women, like all others I ever saw in any Indian tribe, divide the hair on the forehead, and paint the separation or crease with vermilion or red earth.

Gernreich, born in Austria in 1922, emigrated to the U.S. with his mother in 1938, fleeing Nazi persecution of Jews and settling in Los Angeles. Along with his then-partner, activist Harry Hay and others, he was a founding member of the Mattachine Society, an early LGBTQ/gay rights organization, around 1950. Gernreich first worked as a dancer and in costume design in Los Angeles, eventually becoming known for avant-garde fashion designs. Many of his clothes were “unisex,” intended for men and women alike, as he sought to detach clothing from gender—designing skirts for men, pants for women—and remove the stigma of nudity. His body conscious and often minimalist designs can be interpreted as celebrations of the body and statements against sexual repression."},{"label":"Location","content":"Currently not on view"}],"credits":[{"label":"Credit Line","content":"Gift of Estate of Rudi Gernreich (through: Oreste F.
